# 4Adventure
A website to log the stories of a group of 4 motorcycle friends

# Installation
A image of the DB is attached to the project, so to make it funcional is just required to restore that database and change the /includes/class/Config.php file accordingly

# Display the website
To display the website you just need to point to the "www" folder. 

In the case of shared hosting, where the "includes" folder would have to be placed wihtin the "www" folder, an .htaccess rule could be used to prevent unauthorized access to critical code.
Also don't forget to change to ROOT path on the /includes/class/Config.php file.
